**📊 Retail Analytics 360°: End-to-End Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI & DAX)**

A dynamic and interactive data visualization project built to analyze retail sales performance across revenue, customers, transactions, geography, and time — enabling business-driven decision making through structured insights.

## 2. Short Description / Purpose

The Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to transform raw retail transaction data into meaningful insights. It enables users to explore revenue trends, customer behavior, cancellations, and geographic performance through dynamic filters and time-based analysis.


## 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

* 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization and reporting platform
* 🔄 **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation
* 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated columns and measures
* 🔗 **Data Modeling** – Relationship management between multiple tables
* 🗂️ **GitHub** – Project hosting and documentation

## 4. Data Source

The dataset consists of multiple retail data files integrated into a unified data model:

* Sales transaction data
* Customer-level data
* City Tier classification data
* PinCode-to-Zone geographic mapping data

The data was cleaned, missing values were handled, and relationships were properly defined to ensure accurate reporting.

## 5. Features / Highlights

###  Business Problem

Retail organizations generate large volumes of transactional data across multiple regions and customer segments. However, raw data alone makes it difficult to quickly answer questions such as:

* What is the overall sales performance?
* How do revenue and transactions trend over time?
* Which regions or city tiers perform better?
* What is the impact of cancellations on total sales?
* How does weekday vs weekend performance compare?

An interactive dashboard is required to convert this raw data into actionable insights.

### 🔹 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver a comprehensive and interactive visual tool that:

* Provides a high-level KPI overview
* Tracks monthly and weekly sales trends
* Compares performance across Zones and City Tiers
* Analyzes cancellations and net sales impact
* Supports strategic business decision-making
